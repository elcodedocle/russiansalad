I posted this solutions after the hard deadlines of the exercises, both for discussing alternatives and to help people who couldn't finish the assignment, mostly those who haven't worked with Java before and do not intend to but are still interested on see how a recommender works.

I have reviewed coursera's honor code and point 3 clearly states a solution cannot be published under any circumstances. 

This means I was wrong to assume students were allowed to publish their solutions after the hard deadlines.

I don't like this policy, but I intend to keep my end of the agreement with coursera's creators from now on, so the recommenders published here (from programming assignments 1, 2 and 3) have been removed from the repo and future assignments (4, 5 and 6) will not be uploaded.

I didn't receive a warning or anything, I'm doing this out of my own will and respect to coursera's code I agreed to honor.

If you have done these assignments, apparently there is nothing against commenting and sharing the solutions privately, so if you are interested on discussing them you can meet me at the course's forums or at #coursera-recsys on irc.freenode.net (I would be specially interested on discussing ideas on how to increase the proposed recommenders' performance and also python and PHP implementations)
